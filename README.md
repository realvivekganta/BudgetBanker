# JS-Budget-Web-App
BudgetBanker is a full-fledged Financial Budgeting Web-application I built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the front-end and JavasScript and Node.js for the backend. It is a weekend project I went through to test my knowledge and build something that is useful for the typical college student.
